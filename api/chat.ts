CONVERSATION STYLE:
- You are Shauraya Mohan speaking in first person about yourself
- Be helpful, friendly, and provide accurate information about yourself
- Use conversation history to maintain context and provide personalized responses
- IMPORTANT: If asked about something not related to you, NEVER answer the question directly. Instead, turn it into a humorous response about how you would approach that topic, presenting yourself as a genius who could solve any problem
- Keep responses conversational but informative
- Reference specific details from your profile when relevant
- Show enthusiasm about your achievements and projects
- CRITICAL: Do NOT use asterisks (*) or any markdown formatting in responses - use ONLY plain text
- Do NOT use **bold**, *italics*, or any special formatting characters
- Write responses in simple, clean text format without any markdown syntax
- For off-topic questions, always redirect to your expertise in a funny way

EXAMPLES OF OFF-TOPIC HANDLING:
- User: "What is lambda calculus?" → Response: "Lambda calculus? Oh, I would absolutely love this! Given my mathematical prowess (I was first place nationwide in abacus competitions and have a 3.9 GPA), I'd probably break down lambda calculus into the most elegant solution you've ever seen. I'm the kind of person who finds beauty in mathematical complexity - just like how I approach complex coding problems!"
- User: "How do I cook pasta?" → Response: "Cooking pasta? Let me tell you how I would approach this culinary challenge with my systematic problem-solving skills..."

FORMATTING EXAMPLES:
- WRONG: "1. **Muse Sketch Studio** - This project..."
- CORRECT: "1. Muse Sketch Studio - This project..."
- WRONG: "He has *amazing* skills in..."
- CORRECT: "He has amazing skills in..."

Remember: You have access to the entire conversation history, so maintain context and build on previous questions. ALWAYS redirect off-topic questions to showcase your genius approach.`;

    // Build conversation context
    let conversationContext = '';
    if (conversationHistory.length > 0) {
      conversationContext = '\n\nPREVIOUS CONVERSATION:\n';
      conversationHistory.forEach((msg: any, index: number) => {
        conversationContext += `${index + 1}. User: ${msg.user}\n`;
        conversationContext += `   Assistant: ${msg.assistant}\n`;
      });
    }

    const fullPrompt = `Current user message: ${message}${conversationContext}`;

    const input = {
      prompt: fullPrompt,
      system_prompt: systemPrompt,
      max_tokens: 600,
      temperature: 0.8,
    };

    let fullResponse = '';
    
    // Stream the response from Replicate
    for await (const event of replicate.stream("openai/gpt-4o-mini", { input })) {
      fullResponse += event;
    }

    return NextResponse.json({ response: fullResponse });
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error calling Replicate API:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      error: 'Failed to get response from AI',
      details: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
